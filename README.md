detecting if a subject is Covid-19 positive using their chest X-Ray imaging by Deep Learning

1. Obtaining the Dataset

    Training Dataset : 
    https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amanullahasraf/covid19-pneumonia-normal-chest-xray-pa-dataset

    Testing Dataset :

Please Note - I have only taken Normal and Covid-19 image files and not the pneumonia files

2. Upload the Dataset to Google Drive

    I have Uploaded all the dataset to Google Drive and then hooked it up to the Colab file then
    
3. Modelling

    AlexNet, VGG-19 and ZfNet are made by me and GoogleNet/InceptionNet and ResNet-50 were predefined
    
4. Compiling, fitting and Evaluating the models with the datasets
5. Showing Loss and Accuracy curve of all models
